Revision date: 06/21/2022
IMPORTANT - READ CAREFULLY: THIS IS A LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU (" LICENSEE") AND DYNAMSOFT CORPORATION ("DYNAMSOFT"), FOR THE DYNAMSOFT SOFTWARE AND ANY ACCOMPANYING ONLINE OR ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTATION ("SOFTWARE").
BEFORE CONTINUING WITH THE INSTALLATION OF THE SOFTWARE, THE LICENSEE MUST READ, ACKNOWLEDGE AND ACCEPT THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT THAT FOLLOWS ("AGREEMENT"). IF THE LICENSEE DOES NOT ACCEPT THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE AGREEMENT, THE LICENSEE MUST NOT CLICK AN "AGREE" OR SIMILAR BUTTON AND MUST NOT INSTALL OR USE THE SOFTWARE.

1. DEFINITIONS
"Application" means an end user program that the Licensee develops using the Software and into which the Redistributable are incorporated, and which contains significant additional functionality over and above the functionality contained in the Software. In the case of a web Application, an Application means a same-origin Application (same protocol, same host, and same port). Read what is counted as a single application to learn more.
"Licensee" means the person or entity entering into this Agreement with Dynamsoft. Any person who is entering into this Agreement on behalf of an organizational entity represents that he or she has the authority to bind such entity.
"Redistributable" refer to runtime libraries and files intended for duplication and distribution with the Application.
"Software" means the "Dynamsoft Document Normalizer" software and all accompanying components, parts, and documentation that have been developed by Dynamsoft.
2. GRANT OF LICENSE
Dynamsoft grants the Licensee a nonexclusive, non-transferable, revocable and limited license to use the Software and included functionalities for which the Licensee has paid the applicable fees solely for the Licensee's internal business purposes and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The Software is licensed, not sold, to the Licensee. If the Licensee acquires or is provided with any directories, components, connectors, utilities, data, or other items from Dynamsoft for use with the Software (the "Additional Software"), the Licensee's uses of the Additional Software shall be in accordance with the terms, conditions, obligations and restrictions of this Agreement. The term "Software" as used herein, shall be deemed to include the Additional Software and Third-Party Products.
2.1 INSTALLATION AND USE
The Licensee may install and use the Software only in the configuration and for the number of licenses acquired by Licensee. In order to exercise the Licensee's rights to the Software under this License Agreement, Licensee must activate the Licensee's copy of the Software in the manner described during the launch sequence. Dynamsoft may control the number and type of licenses and the use of the Software by key code(s).
2.2 EVALUATION LICENSE
An Evaluation License may be used only for the number and type of licenses specified and for the period specified on the Software packaging, ordering, or shipping documentation. Upon expiration of such specified period, the Software associated with an Evaluation License will not function unless Licensee has obtained applicable full license keys. If the ordering or shipping documentation specifies a particular project, the Software may be used only with that project.
An Evaluation License may only be used for evaluation or testing purposes and may not be used for deployment purposes. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Software provided under an Evaluation License is provided "AS-IS" without warranty or representation of any kind, express or implied. An Evaluation License may be terminated by Dynamsoft Corporation upon written notice at any time.
2.3 DEPLOYMENT LICENSE
A Deployment License allows copying, deployment, and distribution of the Redistributables to end users, without further distribution, as part of the Application for Licensee's internal business purposes, not for resale or transfer to external customers. Upon purchase of the required Deployment License, Dynamsoft will invoice for number, type and duration of Deployment License granted to Licensee. 
Unless otherwise stated in a duly executed agreement, annual subscription licenses will be valid for one year beginning with the license activation date. The Licensee can extend licenses for additional one-year periods (each a "Renewal Term").
2.4 OEM, ASP/SERVICE BUREAU AND OTHER DEPLOYMENT LICENSES
Licensee must execute a separate agreement prior to making any commercial deployment of the Application to third-party end users, either directly or through distribution channels. This may happen when Licensee acts as an ISV, OEM, ASP/service bureau, or solution provider offering the Application to third party end customers.
Applicable and additional licensing options can be discussed with sales@dynamsoft.com.
3. MAINTENANCE SERVICES AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT
Dynamsoft's annual software maintenance and technical support plan benefits are posted on Dynamsoft's website (www.dynamsoft.com) and Dynamsoft reserves the right to amend and modify its technical support policies and annual maintenance plan from time to time, at its sole discretion.
4. EFFECT OF TERMINATION

5. RESTRICTIONS
All rights reserved. Except as expressly permitted by this License Agreement or by applicable law the Licensee may not: (a) lease, loan, resell, assign, sublicense, or otherwise distribute the Software or any of the rights granted by this License Agreement without the express written permission of Dynamsoft;(b) use the Software to provide or operate Application Service Provider (ASP), service bureau, marketing, training, outsourcing services, or consulting services, or any other commercial service related to the Software or to develop training materials; (c) modify (even for purposes of error correction), adapt, or translate the Software or create derivative works therefrom except as necessary to configure the Software using the menus, options and tools provided for such purposes and contained in the Software; (d) in any way reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile the Software (including reverse compiling to ensure interoperability) or any portion thereof except to the extent and for the express purposes authorized by applicable law notwithstanding this limitation; (e) use the Software to develop a product which is competitive with any Dynamsoft product offerings; (f) use unauthorized keycode(s); (g) disclose any Software benchmark results to any third party without Dynamsoft prior written approval, (h) permit third party access to, or use of the Software except as expressly permitted herein, and (i) distribute or publish keycode(s). If the Licensee wishes to exercise any right to reverse engineer to ensure interoperability in accordance with applicable law, the Licensee shall first provide written notice to Dynamsoft and permit Dynamsoft, at its discretion, to make an offer to provide information and assistance reasonably required to ensure Software interoperability with the Licensee's other products for a fee to be mutually agreed upon (if any). 
The Licensee's product is targeted to end users. The end-user application Licensee develops using the Software must not be another development tool and/or SDK.
Users of end-user applications Licensees develop using the Software may not further use the Software, in whole or in part, for software development, copying or distribution. The Licensee must enforce this restriction in a separate agreement between Licensee and the end user of Licensee's applications.
Evaluation License holders are granted the use of only one copy of the Software per Evaluation License. The Software is "in-use" on a computer when it is loaded into temporary memory (i.e. RAM) or installed into the storage device of that computer.
The Licensee may make a single copy of the Software for backup purposes only. Old license(s) will be revoked within 60 days after a license upgrade.
Dynamsoft reserves the right to change these terms and conditions at any time without prior notice.

The Licensee neither owns nor hereby acquires any claim or right of ownership to the Software or to any related patents, copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property. The Licensee agrees to retain the Software, the terms of this Agreement as well as any Software benchmark or similar tests (whether performed by the Licensee, Dynamsoft or any third party) in confidence and prevent them from unauthorized disclosure or use except with Dynamsoft prior written consent.
